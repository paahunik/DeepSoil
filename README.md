This is the source code of work done in paper - "DeepSoil: A Science-guided Framework for Generation of High Precision Soil Moisture Maps by Reconciling Measurement Profiles Across In-situ and Remote Sensing Data". We propose a unified framework to produce higher-precision soil moisture estimates at high spatial resolutions (30m) on daily basis
